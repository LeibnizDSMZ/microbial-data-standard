# Call to action

**Are you a culture collection?**

**Do want to integrate your data with minimal effort?**

### We are looking for microbial culture collections that want to be part of the **Strain discovery database**!

Our goal is to include all willing culture collections globally. All you need to do is
provide your data in the here described microbial data standard.

All the contributed data must have a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) license!

By contributing your data to the system you will gain visibility and comparability. But the strain discovery database
aims to be more than just an extended culture catalogue. To integrating biological knowledge about the strains and to search strains
reliably by their traits this kind of data is required. Therefor will we only include strains that will be provided with such data.

If you want to participate contact [Lorenz Reimer](mailto:lorenz.reimer@dsmz.de)
