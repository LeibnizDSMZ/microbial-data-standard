# Call to action

**Are you working at a culture collection?**

**Do you want to integrate your data with minimal effort?**  

## We are looking for microbial culture collections that want to be part of the **Strain discovery database!**


Our goal is to include all willing culture collections globally. All you need to do is
provide your data in the microbial strain data standard.

All the contributed data must have a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) license!

By contributing your data to the system you will gain visibility and comparability for your strain data. But the strain discovery database
aims to be more than just an extended culture catalogue. Therefore we are explicitly looking for partners that are sharing extended datasets, including physiological or metabolic data (e.g. from API test data or antibiotic susceptibility testing).

If you want to participate contact [Lorenz Reimer](mailto:lorenz.reimer@dsmz.de)
