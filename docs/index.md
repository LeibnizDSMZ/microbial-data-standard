## The Data Standard

We provide multiple options to communicate the new data standard. First there is a
visual representation ([Graph](graph.md))of the new data standard.
Under **Data Schema** you find a full human readable documentation of the different
parts. Last there are [examples](examples/data_1.md) of the new data standard.


## Pydantic Model

The full pydantic data model is available [here](python/microbe.md).
