# Microbial strain data

### Microbial strains and culture collections

When a scientist isolates a microorganism (e.g. Bacteria, Yeast, ...) the isolate and all
clones of it is called from now on a strain. Strain can be deposited at culture collections.
Culture collections are BRC's (Biological Resource Centers) and the collections provide
access to the biological resources (the microbial strains) for researchers and/or
industry. Every culture collection gives each strain in their collection a unique
identification number, also known as culture collection number (CCNo).

### Number of microbial strains
There are more than 800 culture collections world wide according to
[WDCM](https://ccinfo.wdcm.org/), with a combined number of more than 4 million
microbial **deposits**. A deposit is a strain at a culture collection.
The combined number of microbial **strains** is unknown because one strain
can be deposited in multiple culture collections and there is no complete matching of the
microbial resources of all culture collections.
[StrainInfo](https://straininfo.dsmz.de) is trying to provide an overview on which culture
 belongs to which strain.
There is also [BacDive](https://bacdive.de/), the largest database for standardized
bacterial information, that accumulates cultures and associated biological knowledge
to strains.

### Standardized microbial data
In a lot of cases culture collection provide an online catalogue of their available
strains (e.g.
[DSMZ](https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/microorganisms/catalogue),
[CECT](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/spanish-type-culture-collection/en/cect/strains/culture-media-catalogue-/strains-search-engine-1285892802374.html),
[Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/fungal_table)).
The information about the strains in these catalogues are often lacking deeper biological
knowledge, even if this knowledge is available at the collection. Another issue is that
all of these collection do hold their data in different formats. There is no overarching
standardization of microbial strain data in use, even if there have been attempts to
introduce standards to microbial strain data (MCL, CABRI, MINE, ...)

### Why a new standard?
The EU project **Bioindustry 4.0** brings together experts from multiple culture
collections, research infrastructures and microbial databases. The goal is to implement
a new strain discovery database that integrates the data from the [DSMZ](https://dsmz.de),
[CECT](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/spanish-type-culture-collection/en/spanish-type-culture-collection/cect-a-reserve-microbial-diversity-1285872233521/Recurs.html?id=1286053036934)
and the [Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/). The goal is to provide a unified
**Strain Discovery Database** to search for strains by there biological traits
independently from the culture collections catalogues that provide the strains.
To reach this goal we have to define a standard to hold, share and compare the strain
data from different institutes.
This project will ease the process of finding the right microbe for a task,
emphasize the microbial diversity at culture collections and enhance visibility
for smaller collections. Further more data quality about the strains will be improved by
merging information from different sources, uncertainty about the origin and restrictions
about a strain are reduced and thereby the overall quality of microbial science
will profit from such a system.
