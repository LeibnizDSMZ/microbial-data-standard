# Microbial strain data

## Microbial strains and culture collections

When a scientist isolates a microorganism (e.g. Bacteria, Yeast, ...) the isolate and all
clones of it is called from now on a strain. If the strain is of a new taxon or the strain
should be referenced in a publication it will get deposited at a culture collection.
Culture collections are BRC's (Biological resource centers) and the collections provide
access to the biological resources (the microbial strains) for researchers and/or
industry. Every culture collection gives each strain in their collection a unique
identification number (aka culture collection number (CCNo)).

## Number of microbial strains
There are more than 800 culture collections world wide according to
[WDCM](https://ccinfo.wdcm.org/), with a combined number of more than 4 million
microbial cultures. The combined number of microbial strains is unknown because one strain
can be deposited in multiple culture collections and there is no complete matching of the
microbial resources of all culture collections.
[StrainInfo](https://straininfo.dsmz.de) is trying to accumulate the unique culture
collection resources to strains.
There is also [BacDive](https://bacdive.de/) the largest database for standardized
bacterial information that accumulates cultures that occur at multiple culture collections
to strains, but this is only for bacteria and archaea.

## Standardized microbial data
In a lot of cases culture collection provide an online catalogue of their available
strains (e.g.
[DSMZ](https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/microorganisms/catalogue),
[CECT](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/spanish-type-culture-collection/en/cect/strains/culture-media-catalogue-/strains-search-engine-1285892802374.html),
[CBS (Westerdijk Institute)](https://wi.knaw.nl/fungal_table),
[CCUG](https://www.ccug.se/collections/search?collection=entire)).
The information in these catalogues are often lacking deeper biological
knowledge, even if this knowledge is available at the collection. Another issue is that
all of these collection do hold their data in different formats. There is no overarching
standardization of microbial strain data in use, even if there have been attempts to
introduce standards to microbial strain data (MCL, CABRI, MINE, ...)

## Why now a new standard?
The EU project **Bioindustry 4.0** brings together experts from multiple culture
collections, research infrastructures and microbial databases. The goal is to implement
a new strain discovery database that integrates the data from the [DSMZ](https://dsmz.de)
and their database [BacDive](https://bacdive.de/), from the
[CECT](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/spanish-type-culture-collection/en/spanish-type-culture-collection/cect-a-reserve-microbial-diversity-1285872233521/Recurs.html?id=1286053036934)
and the [MIRRI](https://www.mirri.org/) consortium, as well as from the
[Westerdijk Institute](https://wi.knaw.nl/) and their collections of fungi
([CBS](https://wi.knaw.nl/fungal_table)) and bacteria ([NCCB](https://wi.knaw.nl/nccb_strains_table)).
